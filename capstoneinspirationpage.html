            <p><b>Riley Hospital for Children</b></p>
            <img src="img/riley.jpg"/>
            <p>Riley Hospital for Children is Indiana’s only comprehensive children’s hospital, with pediatric specialists 
            in every field of medicine and surgery. Located in Indianapolis, Riley is committed to providing the highest 
            quality health care to children in a compassionate, family-centered environment. Riley is a national leader in 
            cutting edge research and medical education, ensuring health care excellence for children for generations to come. 
            Riley treats all patients, regardless of their family’s financial standing, and serves over 150,000 patients a year.
            It has more care-beds than any other children’s hospital in the nation and is among the fifteen largest hospitals in 
            the U.S. of any kind. More than 80 percent of all Hoosier children with cancer are treated at Riley, and the first 
            pediatric cardiopulmonary diagnostic center in the nation is located there as well.  Riley houses the only pediatric 
            burn center and pediatric dialysis center in the state, and also happens to be supported by the second largest Ronald 
            McDonald house in the world. </p>

	    <p>Riley is more than just a hospital though.  Riley is a source of hope and comfort for people everywhere.  
	    The moment you set foot in the building, you know you are in the best company and care in the entire world.  
	    The miracles that happen on a daily basis and the millions of Riley kids whose lives have been forever changed 
	    by the incredible staff there are the most inspirational combination we know of.  Even amidst all the uncertainty
	    in Washington surrounding the future of healthcare, Riley continues to provide comprehensive medical coverage to 
	    any child who needs it regardless of their ability to pay.  When you donate to Riley, you are contributing 
	    directly to these kids and these miracles.</p>

	    <p>Below is a short video showing  one of the many miracles made possible by Riley:</p>

            <p><b>Ryan White</b></p>
            <img src = "img/RyanWhite_PeopleMagcover.jpg"/>
	    <p>IUDM was established to memorialize the courageous life and story of Ryan White. Ryan was a typical 13-year-old 
	    Hoosier when he contracted AIDS through contaminated blood transfusions he received for hemophilia. When news of his 
	    diagnosis became public, his school district in Kokomo, Indiana denied him the right to return to classes. The 
	    ensuing court battles made headlines across the country and national celebrities like Michael Jackson and Elton John 
	    became friends with Ryan and advocated on his behalf. Ryan was not just fighting against his school district, but a 
	    , misinformed community.</p>

	    <p>Ryan won the right to return to school, but this battle with the community and the disease itself had just 
	    begun. The White’s struggled through many traumatic experiences at the hand of the people in the community. The 
	    family dealt with the fear and anger of these people on a daily basis hoping that eventually things would return 
	    normal. However, after a bullet was fired into the White home, the family moved to Cicero, Indiana, where they 
	    found peace.</p>

	    <p></p>Throughout his own struggles with the disease and public misconceptions, Ryan spoke out. He combated 
	    bigotry with calls for compassion and appeared at schools and fundraisers across the country. He even testified 
	    before the President’s Commission on AIDS.</p>

	    <p>After a courageous struggle, Ryan White died on April 8, 1990, the spring before he had planned to attend 
	    Indiana University. His fight to help those afflicted with infectious diseases is continued, in part, by the 
	    Indiana University Dance Marathon Council. In memory of Ryan’s life and work, the annual Dance Marathon benefits
	    Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and established the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center.</p>
	    
	    <p>Below is video created in Ryan's honor: </p>

            <p><b>Ashley Louise Crouse</b></p>
            <img src="img/ACrouse.jpg" />
            <p>On April 12, 2005 the IU campus suffered a tremendous loss.  Ashley Louise Crouse, a member of Kappa Kappa 
            Gamma sorority and IUDM Executive Council, became our angel on that tragic day. </p>

	    <p>For those who knew Ashley, they will always her warm smile, welcoming personality and passion for life.  As VP of 
	    Communications on the IUDM Executive Council, Ashley worked hard for a cause she believe in.  Ashley’s hometown 
	    of Carmel, Indiana has joined with IUDM to create one of them most successful high school dance marathons in the 
	    country. </p>

	    <p>We honor her life and the way she lived by wearing her initials, ALC, on all IUDM apparel and literature.  
	    When you see Ashley’s initials, remember to live each day to its fullest and to never stop reaching for your 
	    dreams. </p>

       	    <p>Here is a video created in Ashley’s Honor:</p>
